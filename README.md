# Backbase accelerator portal
create a user friendly overview of all our github repositories aka accelorators.

## description

Backbase is undertaking an initiative to revamp its official website by providing a refreshed catalog of available accelerators. This effort stems from the observed clutter on GitHub, where outdated files linger without utility.

The primary objective is to bring clarity and accessibility to users seeking current and pertinent information. Through this initiative, Backbase aims to streamline the user experience, making it effortless for companies and individuals to discover and access relevant accelerators.

The Accelerator Portal is designed to cater to a diverse audience keen on exploring more about Backbase's apps and services. Whether seeking information or examples, the portal serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in the offerings provided by Backbase.
